# JaipuR
Jaipur Cardgame as a R-Application.

The Maharajah of Jaipur, capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan, is looking for a new purveyor to the court. Two merchants compete for this privilege, but only the more successful of the two will receive the approval. In the role of these merchants, players must purchase goods and sell them at the highest possible profit in order to have the most rupees at the end of each round.

The R-Package JaipuR is a shiny-application for the card game Jaipur. It is only played on a single device, and players take turns playing. A Screenshot of the game-play can be found below:

Since the game is only played on a single device and therefore only on a single screen, the honesty of the players is extremely important. It is crucial for the game play, that the opposing player does only know his/her cards and never knows the cards of her/his opponent.
