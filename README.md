# JaipuR
Jaipur Cardgame as a R-Application.

The Maharajah of Jaipur, capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan, is looking for a new purveyor to the court. Two merchants compete for this privilege, but only the more successful of the two will receive the approval. In the role of these merchants, players must purchase goods and sell them at the highest possible profit in order to have the most rupees at the end of each round.

The R-Package JaipuR is a shiny-application for the card game Jaipur. It is only played on a single device, and players take turns playing.
